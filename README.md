Side projects I made as a hobby

- Chart Maker : Creates pie chart according to input from input bar (input : CSV of name:value:color(hex)).
- Circle Cover : Fills the screen with randomly generated circles without them overlapping each other. Number of circles is the input.
- Grid Draw : Parses code from input bar and draws pixel art on grid. More of it over [here](https://github.com/MilkBomb11/GridDraw)
- Fourier Transform : User can draw thing with mouse and the computer imitates the drawing using fourier transform.
- Mine Sweeper: Mine sweeper game. Press space to change between "excavate" mode and "mark" mode.
- Sine Wave : Sine wave visualization with oscillatng objects.
- Genetic Algorithm : An algorithm that simulates Darwin's theory of evolution using text. You can input the target sentence on the input bar and switch the process mode between "Autopilot" and "Generation by Generation".
- Curve Table : Lissajous Curve Table in P5.js.
- Ray Casting : Mouse to draw boundaries. Press space to switch mode to raycast mode. Use slider to change the vision range of ray cast
- Universe : A virtual universe obeying the law of universal gravitation, Newton's law of motion, the law of conservation of momentum, and the law of conservation of mass. Click mouse to create planets, set their initial velocity, and mouse wheel to set each of their mass. Press space bar to start simulation and end simulation.
- Simple Pendulum : Creates 2 ~ 9 pendulums that obey the laws of physics, attached on a single pivot, each having a random initial angle, radius(mass/2), and arm length.
- Landscape : Generates natural landscape using Perlin noise. Tried to implement flying over the terrain but failed due to limits of p5.js WEBGL. So there is an unlaggy Processing(Java) version of it in the "landsape" folder of the "Landscape" folder.
- Number Pyramid : Generates a pyramid with N floors where each floor is an arithmetic sequence and each sequence's first element, common difference, and length is N. (N can be controlled in code)
- Link Net : Draws N sets each having n nodes. Each node is connected to every node of the set next to the set which it is contained in.
- Laser : There are 2 modes : "make" and "simulate". In "make" mode, draw walls that can reflect lasers. In simulate mode, control a laser cannon and shoot lasers. Switch between modes by pressing space.
- PolarCoordinate : Visualizes a sequence of vectors where the nth term is (n, n) in a polar coordinate system.
- TerrainGeneration : Creates a randomly generated natural-looking terrain with Perlin noise. With your mouse you can rotate(left mouse button), zoom(right mouse button), and pan(middle mouse button(Press the wheel itself)) the view.
  - Credits : The camera functionality was possible thanks to [Peasycam by Jonathan Feinberg](http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/).
- PixelManipulation : Manipulates a photo's pixel and displays a new photo with cool effects on it.
- Cannon : A cannon that can shoot a cannonball that obeys Newton's law of motion, its trajectory determined by the cannon's angle and power. You can control the size of gravity, mass of a cannonball, and the power of the cannon via sliders.
- Conway : "Conway's game of life" simulator. Use mouse to place cells and press space to start simulation. More about conway's game of life can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
- CirclesColliding : Circles colliding each other. Some of the circles sometimes get stuck to each other and sadly I'm not a genius so I have no clue how to solve it.
- Oscillation : Things moving in a synchronous oscillating behavior to create cool patterns.
- Bezier : A quadratic bezier curve generation algorithm. You can play around with the curve using mouse.
- FunctionVisualizer : Visualizes mathematical functions on a cartesian coordinate system.
- SlitScan : Slit-scan effect in p5.js.
- TangentsOfCircle : Draws every line that is tangent to the circle and passes through the coordinate of the mouse on a cartesian coordinate system. Use mouse wheel to change the circle's radius and use WASD to move the circle.
- ScreenRecorder : Records screen and replays it. You can toggle between record mode and replay mode by pressing 'X'. Player can be controlled with WASD or arrow keys.
- protein_synthesis : Gets the length of the nucleic sequence and the nucleic sequence itself as the input. Prints out the transcripted and the translated version of the DNA. (Didn't implemented initiation and termination.)
- Protein Synthesis : p5.js version of protein_synthesis.
- EvolutionSimulation : Simulates Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. There is a button that can, when pressed, simulate overproduction and mutation by making the existing entities reproduce, and a one that can simulate survival of the fittest.
- Elasticity : A spinning spring contraption that is affected by elasticity only.(Gravity is ignored)
- Orbit: A simulation of a planet orbiting a star. You can change the initial velocity and initial distance between the planet and the star and fiddle with it.
- Gird_Filling: Left-click land squares to turn them into water and vice versa. Right-click to plant grass on a land square. Grass will spread until it meets water.
- ml2: Lexer, parser, interpreter for a functional toy language inspired by Ocaml.
- regex_parser: Given a source text file with the format [test_string]|[regex], it will return if the test string is one that the regex recognizes. The regex parser generates a nondeterministic finite automata with the regular expression it was provided. Then, it tests whether the finite automata can reach the end when the test string is given as input. The C++ version uses vectors for the dynamic array of transitions each node of the finite automata has whereas the C version uses a dynamically allocated stack. This means creating new transitions for nodes, the C++ version has an amortized O(1) time complexity while the C version has O(1) time complexity. So theoretically, the C version should be faster, the margin of which I don't know the significance of.
- stack_lang: Lexer, compiler, virtual machine for an imperative toy language inspired by C.
- ll_parser: the lexer tokenizes the provided source file and the parser generates a list of rules based on the stream of tokens. Then it generates an abstract syntax tree based on the list of rules. The evaluator walks the AST to return a result. The parser is an LL(1) parser, which means that it cannot handle left recursion, so every operator is right associative if the evaluator walks the tree naively. To implement left associativity, the evaluator pushes the operators and values on a list when it meets an auxilary node and calculates the values in the list when it meets a regular node. This way, it can control the order each operation will be performed.
- Graph_Plot: Type in a relation between variables y and x. The program will plot a graph for it. Used a recursive descent parser to parse equations and the marching square algorithm to visualize contours generated by the evaluated values. It is buggy when dealing with graphs with asymmetric vertical asymptotes.
- differentiation: Given an equation and a variable name, the program performs a partial differentiation of the equation. If the equation is of the form f(x)=g(x), it will automatically change it to f(x)-g(x)=0 before performing the differentiation. The AST of the original equation, the AST of the partial derivative, the AST of the flattened partial derivative is printed out.
