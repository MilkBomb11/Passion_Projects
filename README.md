Side projects I made as a hobby

- Chart Maker : Creates pie chart according to input from input bar (input : CSV of name:value:color(hex)).
- Circle Cover : Fills the screen with randomly generated circles without them overlapping each other. Number of circles is the input.
- Grid Draw : Parses code from input bar and draws pixel art on grid. More of it over [here](https://github.com/MilkBomb11/GridDraw)
- Fourier Transform : User can draw thing with mouse and the computer imitates the drawing using fourier transform.
- Mine Sweeper: Mine sweeper game. Press space to change between "excavate" mode and "mark" mode.
- Sine Wave : Sine wave visualization with oscillatng objects
- Genetic Algorithm : An algorithm that simulates Darwin's theory of evolution using text.
- Curve Table : Lissajous Curve Table in P5.js.
- Ray Casting : Mouse to draw boundaries. Press space to switch mode to raycast mode. Use slider to change the vision range of ray cast
- Universe : A virtual universe obeying the law of universal gravitation, Newton's law of motion, the law of conservation of momentum, and the law of conservation of mass. Click mouse to create planets, set their initial velocity, and mouse wheel to set each of their mass. Press space bar to start simulation and end simulation.
- Simple Pendulum : Creates 2 ~ 9 pendulums that obey the laws of physics, attached on a single pivot, each having a random initial angle, radius(mass/2), and arm length.
- Landscape : Generates natural landscape using Perlin noise. Tried to implement flying over the terrain but failed due to limits of p5.js WEBGL. So there is an unlaggy Processing(Java) version of it in the "landsape" folder of the "Landscape" folder.
- Number Pyramid : Generates a pyramid with N floors where each floor is an arithmetic sequence and each sequence's first element, common difference, and length is N. (N can be controlled in code)
- Link Net : Draws N sets each having n nodes. Each node is connected to every node of the set next to the set which it is contained in.
- Laser : There are 2 modes : "make" and "simulate". In "make" mode, draw walls that can reflect lasers. In simulate mode, control a laser cannon and shoot lasers. Switch between modes by pressing space.
- PolarCoordinate : Visualizes a sequence of vectors where the nth term is (n, n) in a polar coordinate system.
- TerrainGeneration : Creates a randomly generated natural-looking terrain with Perlin noise. With your mouse you can rotate(left mouse button), zoom(right mouse button), and pan(middle mouse button(Press the wheel itself)) the view.
  - Credits : The camera functionality was possible thanks to [Peasycam by Jonathan Feinberg](http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/).
- PixelManipulation : Manipulates a photo's pixel and displays a new photo with cool effects on it.
- Cannon : A cannon that can shoot a cannonball that obeys Newton's law of motion, its trajectory determined by the cannon's angle and power. You can control the size of gravity, mass of a cannonball, and the power of the cannon via sliders.
- Conway : "Conway's game of life" simulator. Use mouse to place cells and press space to start simulation. More about conway's game of life can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
- CirclesColliding : Circles colliding each other. Some of the circles sometimes get stuck to each other and sadly I'm not a genius so I have no clue how to solve it.
- Oscillation : Things moving in a synchronous oscillating behavior to create cool patterns.
- Bezier : A quadratic bezier curve generation algorithm. You can play around with the curve using mouse.
- FunctionVisualizer : Visualizes mathematical functions on a cartesian coordinate system.
